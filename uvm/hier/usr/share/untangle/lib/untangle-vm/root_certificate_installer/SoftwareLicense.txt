3.3 User Bands. Untangle products and services are priced by bands for different sized companies and networks. The appropriate band can be calculated by counting the number of unique devices behind Untangle on any given day. More explicitly, it is the number of unique IP addresses on any non-WAN (local) interface including VPN users seen from midnight to midnight the next day. If the number of unique IP addresses is below the upper bound of the subscription band for that server, that license subscription is fully compliant.

3.4 User Bands in NFR Subscriptions. Untangle licenses certain subscriptions to its distribution partners under a Not For Resale (“NFR”) arrangement. As part of this arrangement, Untangle allows that partner to exceed the upper end of the subscription’s user band as specified in Section 3.3 (User Bands) only if (a) the software is being used exclusively by the partner for its internal operations and is not being resold in any form, or (b) the software is being used by the partner for trials at its customer locations, so long as the trial does not extend beyond 30 days in any one location and the number of unique IP addresses being covered in the trial does not exceed three times the maximum number allowed under the NFR subscription’s defined user band. Any usage outside of these two exceptions must comply with the terms of Section 3.3 (User Bands) of this Agreement

3.5 Open Source Software. Some software code incorporated into or distributed with the Software Products may be licensed by third parties under various "open-source" or "public-source" software licenses (such as the GNU General Public License, the GNU Lesser General Public License, the Apache License, the Berkeley Software Distribution License, and the Sun Public License) (collectively, the "Open Source Software"). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Open Source Software is not licensed under Section 2 (License Grants), and instead is separately licensed pursuant to the terms and conditions of their respective open-source software licenses, copies of which are either attached to this Agreement, reproduced in the appropriate readme file, or available on the Untangle web site. Licensee agrees to comply with the terms and conditions of such open-source software license agreements.

3.6 Additional Terms. The use of particular Software Products may be subject to additional or supplementary terms and conditions, which Licensee will be given the opportunity to review and accept after download at the time of installation. If Licensee elects to proceed with the installation of such a Software Product, such additional or supplementary terms and conditions shall be incorporated by reference into this Agreement.

3.7 Ownership. The Software Products are licensed, not sold, and as between Licensee and Untangle, Untangle shall retain all right, title, and ownership in and to the Software, including all intellectual property rights contained therein. There are no implied licenses under this Agreement, and all rights not expressed granted are reserved.

4. Updates. Subject to Licensee's payment of the applicable monthly subscription fee in accordance with Section 5.2 (Subscription Fees), Untangle will make available all Updates to the Software Products to Licensee within a reasonable time after the general public release of such Updates. Untangle will make available such Updates for automatic installation using an unmodified installation of the Untangle Platform as released by Untangle. Untangle is not responsible if any Update fails to properly download, install, or operate on an Untangle Platform that has been modified by or obtained from any person other than Untangle. Licensee will be responsible for providing Internet connectivity allowing the Untangle Platform to communicate with Untangle's servers. For the avoidance of doubt, Untangle makes no representations as to the frequency of Updates, nor does it guarantee that any particular Update will be implemented or that any particular errors will be corrected. In addition, this Agreement creates no obligation for Untangle to provide any telephone, e-mail, or other technical support for the Software Products; rather, the parties may enter into a separate support agreement governing the provision of such support by Untangle.

5. Fees and Payments

5.2 Payment Authorization. Licensee agrees to make the foregoing payments (including any applicable taxes) via a valid credit card, Paypal or other authorized payment method, and authorizes Untangle to automatically charge such amounts against the credit card, Paypal or other applicable payment information furnished by Licensee to Untangle via Untangle’s billing system. Licensee agrees to provide Untangle with a valid credit card and accurate, complete, and updated information required by the payment information interface in the Untangle Library. Licensee authorizes Untangle to automatically charge the applicable fees at the beginning of each month (or at such other billing interval as Licensee may select using the account setup function of the Untangle Library), until Licensee elects to terminate the subscription to one or more Software Products in accordance with the terms of each individual subscription.
