For 2.5
-------
change 'clean' to 'remove'

What should be semantics when a shutdown arrives for a disabled queue.


---

check closed/closed state (for released before new session time)

make sure old reports (like index.html) don't bust anything

what else is in db dir?

try system when nameserver is slow (when are we doing reverse lookups? known: spam)

Need to use dist-upgrade instead of upgrade?

Use new atomic stuff instead of volatile or synchronized where appropriate

reports
    -- use dhcp names when available

----------

  -- find pdf output option
  -- requirement issues:
    -- customizability -- allow co-branding with VAR?
    -- allow for 'standard' footer on each emailed report (mv branding/ad)?
    -- is dhcp name source a requirement for 1.4?
  -- reports should be archived, not thrown away for 30 days
  -- limit max size of reports (to like 20 pages?)
  -- issue: right now we always generate reports, even if no reporting transform purchased/loaded/started.
    -- could separate reporting from rollup, only run the rollup if no transform, or could leave as is.
  -- issue: allow for running not at 6:25, but at some other user-specified time
  -- reports to add
    -- which IP sending spam? (in each direction?)
    -- which email recip is receiving the most spam
    -- log parse errors (http incident report)
    -- dhcp/dns reports
    -- add sessions per host
    -- too long reports -- custom
  -- report performance must be analayzed, indices added where appropriate
    -- if we add UI log viewing, we'll need some permanent indices.




email
-----
  -- add per-protocol controls for in/out
  -- figure out if our hand-written base64 encoding/decoding is sufficient


RFEs from one meeting

restart all transforms

  fix serial uids

--    

Need to add check code for tcp & udp send packet so that if you try to send data to a closed
sink, it doesn't just build up but rather gives an error. done?

rename closeWhenDone to avoid cho confusion

fix up uses of proto_tcp now that we have constants.

---

returning readbuf isn't right wrt read limit

killSession() (TCP and UDP) broken when exception occurs in handler (eg: blocker null pointer)

script list for dirk
