/* !!!IMPORTANT!!! (portability issues)
 * CBufferWrapper implements CharSequence
 * to handle read-only access to characters
 * (based on arbitrary, single-byte charsets)
 * stored in given ByteByffer.
 * Each single-byte charset defines alphanumeric characters
 * on single code page and
 * this alphanumeric code page is derived
 * from US-ASCII (ANSI_X3.4-1968) charset.
 * (e.g., charset's code/value for character 'a' equals
 *  US-ASCII's code/value for character 'a', etc.)
 * - alphanumeric characters include (a-z,A-Z,0-9,punct,special chars
 *   like carriage return, line feed, etc)
 * - for Latin-based charsets, this assumption regarding code page is true
 * - for other charsets, this assumption regarding code page is not guaranteed
 * CBufferWrapper does not maintain any independent state info
 * for its underlying ByteBuffer.
 *
 * Unicode is double-byte charset that
 * reuses alphanumeric code page of US-ASCII charset.
 *
 * Given that:
 * Java defines char datatype (double-byte) as Unicode character.
 * Channels/Line buffers operate on ByteByffers
 * (based on (single) byte datatype)
 * to accept/return data.
 * -> We assume that data,
 *    that we handle through channels,
 *    are based on single-byte, Latin-based charsets and
 *    thus, we can use CBufferWrapper to wrap ByteBuffer.
 *    (This saves us the extra step of copying (converting) byte data
 *     to/from char form.)
 *    (We cannot update CBufferWrapper objects and
 *     must not feed CBufferWrapper objects to any method that
 *     tries to do so since
 *     CBufferWrapper maintains backing data in byte form and
 *     not in char form while
 *     the update methods expect data in char form.)
 * -> If we get data (through channels) that
 *    are based on multi-byte charsets,
 *    we must use Charset decoders and encoders
 *    to copy byte data to/from char form and
 *    cannot use CBufferWrapper.
