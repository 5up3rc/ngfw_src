/**
 * This interface is a strange beast.  It is intended as an
 * abstraction to the bytes which comprise a MIME message, which
 * may be within a file (or memory, esp for testing).  Since we are
 * limited by the file semantics, we cannot offer random access to
 * any byte[] for the underlying MIME content.  Instead, instances
 * of this interface offer a Stream.  Here's where things get ugly.
 * <p>
 * In an ideal world, this would inherit from InputStream.  However, things
 * get a bit confusing if that path is taken.  First of all, most of the heavy
 * lifting is done by a class {@link MIMEParsingInputStream MIMEParsingInputStream}.
 * I'd like to be able to use that class independent of this interface.  Instead,
 * we offer a method to produce such a Stream on instances of this class.
