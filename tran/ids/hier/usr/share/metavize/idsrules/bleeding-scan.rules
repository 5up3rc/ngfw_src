# Bleeding Snort scan rules. 
#  These are rules not stable, mature, or applicable enough to be part of the snort.org official sets. 
#  Someday some may be, at which time they'll be removed from this list and be available via Snort.org
#  This is for the bleeding edge junkies. Use at your own risk!!!
#
# SID's are 2000000+ to avoid conflicts
#
# Only basic testing has been done. At this point all we guarantee is that they won't crash a recent snort release. 
#
# More information available at www.bleedingsnort.com
#
# Please submit any custom rules or ideas to bleeding@bleedingsnort.com or the snort-sigs mailing list
