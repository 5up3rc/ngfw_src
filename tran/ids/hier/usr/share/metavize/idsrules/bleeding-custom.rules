# Bleeding Snort Custom rules. 
#  These are rules not stable, mature, or applicable enough to be part of the snort.org official sets. 
#  Someday some may be, at which time they'll be removed from this list and be available via Snort.org
#  This is for the bleeding edge junkies. Use at your own risk!!!
#
#------------------
# These rules are those that are commented out of the rulesets by default. 
#   They require you to look at them and make the following decisions:
#
# Are they right for my network?
# What sensors do I run them on (Internal, external, trusted nets, untrusted, dmz, etc)
# Do I need to change or add variables in snort.conf?
# Are my HOME_NET and EXTERNAL_NET set to something that will conflict with a rule here?
#
# If you find a rule to run you can simply enable it in the main rulesets via oinkmaster or other 
#  mechanisms. You do not need to add this file to your includes, these rules already exist in the 
#  main sets and the rules themselves are maintained in the normal database.
#
#------------------
#
#
# SID's are 2000000+ to avoid conflicts
#
# Only basic testing has been done. At this point all we guarantee is that they won't crash a recent snort release.
