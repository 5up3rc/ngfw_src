./getPatterns.sh grabs all the patterns and puts them in patterns/
./mkLoadPatterns.sh makes a LoadPatterns.java file that is then copied into the srcdir

In order to update the signatures, all you should have to do is run ./getPatterns.sh
then mkLoadPatterns.sh will be invoked from ant build script
