/**
 * Class representing an SmtpTransaction.  Maintains
 * the state of the transaction (see the enum, which
 * I don't know how to reference with JavaDoc)
 * as well as any TO/FROM EmailAddresses.
 * <br>
 * Since there is some gray area in the "middle"
 * between client and server, this class maintains
 * envelope data (recipients and sender)
 * as "provisional" until they are "confirmed".
 * Confirmed means the server accepted, provisional
 * means the request was issued by client yet final
 * disposition is unknown.
 * <br>
 * <br>
 * This class also implements {@link com.untangle.tran.util.TemplateValues TemplateValues}.
 * Valid key names which can be derefferenced from an SmtpTransaction begin with
 * the literal <code>$SMTPTransaction:</code> followed by any of the following tokens:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>
 *     <code><b>TO</b></code> The "TO" addresses, as passed in any "RCPT TO:" commands.
 *     Each recipient is on its own line.  Even if there is only one recipient,
 *     this variable will be substituted with the value of the recipient <i>followed
 *     by a CRLF.</i>  If there are no recipients (?!?), than this will
 *     simply return a blank String ("").
 *   </li>
 *   <li>
 *     <code><b>FROM</b></code> The "FROM" as passed in the "MAIL FROM:" command.
 *     If there is no FROM value (or it was "&lt;>"), the literal "&lt;>" will be substituted.
 *   </li>
 * </ul>
