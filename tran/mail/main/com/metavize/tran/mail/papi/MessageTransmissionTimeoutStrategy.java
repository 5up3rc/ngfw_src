 * <br><br>
 * Currently, based on the assumption that
 * transmission times between endpoints on each
 * interface are the same.  If it takes "n" seconds
 * to transfer from client->MVVM, it will take "n"
 * seconds to transfer from MVVM -> server.  The total
 * time that the client must wait is assumed to be 2*n.
 * <br><br>
 * Since checking for timeouts is performed while 
 * receiving data from the first endpoint, we evaluate
 * timeout danger by the max wait time for either side
 * divided by 2.
