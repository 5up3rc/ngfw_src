TODO:

- add interfaces knowledge (move from xenon?)
- add marking for interfaces
- netcap should supply indev and outdev for udp (done via SO_PKTINFO)
- fix spin if failed in beginning of handle_x() in server (because EPOLLIN flag stays)
- fix icmp description
- rename queue (queue is OS dependant)

DONE:

rework props to pkt 
send msg to server, server will unsubscribe/subscribe
epoll
physdev is also disabled - reenable for 2.6
added indev and outdev to addrs
add IP_TOS cmsg on udp_send (udpsend kernel patch)
add global udp fd for sending packets
udp with seperate hook and spoofing function
warning if no hooks when subscribe
add a cleanup function (kills all rdr and free's hooks)
thread pool
block current connections flag
broadcast fix (resending will cause duplication on the original interface)

FUTURE:

- put a gateway/bridge flag ?
