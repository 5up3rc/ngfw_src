                       UNTANGLE NETWORKS, INC.
                          LICENSE AGREEMENT

THE UNTANGLE NETWORKS, INC. ("UNTANGLE") HARDWARE (THE "HARDWARE") YOU
HAVE PURCHASED CONTAINS PREVIOUSLY INSTALLED SOFTWARE (THE "INSTALLED
CODE"). UNTANGLE IS ONLY WILLING TO LICENSE THE INSTALLED CODE, AND
THE USER MANUALS AND ONLINE INSTRUCTIONS CONCERNING THE HARDWARE AND
THE INSTALLED CODE (THE "DOCUMENTATION"), AMONG OTHER THINGS, TO THE
INDIVIDUAL OR ENTITY (THE "LICENSEE") PURCHASING THE HARDWARE, UNDER
THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS LICENSE. BY INSTALLING YOUR EDGEGUARD
UNIT, LICENSEE ACKNOWLEDGES ITS ACCEPTANCE OF THESE TERMS AND
CONDITIONS AND FORMS A BINDING LEGAL CONTRACT WITH UNTANGLE. IF
LICENSEE DOES NOT ACCEPT THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, RETURN THE
HARDWARE WITH THE INSTALLED CODE AND DOCUMENTATION TO UNTANGLE.

1.  Grant of License to Installed Code. Upon payment of the applicable
    fees for a Untangle maintenance and support service (the
    "Subscription Service"), Untangle grants to Licensee a
    nontransferable, nonexclusive license to use the Installed Code
    solely in connection with Licensee's use of the Hardware on
    Licensee's computer network.

2.  Maintenance and Support. Upon payment of the applicable fees for
    the Subscription Service, Licensee shall have the right to receive
    the maintenance and support services provided by Untangle
    generally to its other subscribers purchasing the same
    subscription service as Licensee. If any software is provided to
    Licensee as part of the Subscription Service, such software shall
    be provided to Licensee either (a) under the terms of this
    License, as if such software were Installed Code, or (b) under the
    terms of a separate license if a separate license is
    provided. Untangle shall have the right to change the maintenance
    and support services provided to Licensee in the Subscription
    Service from time to time, or cancel the Subscription Service at
    any time, without notice, and refund the pro-rata portion any
    unearned prepaid Subscription Fees.

    Provided that Licensee is current on payment of its Subscription
    Service fees and not otherwise in default of this License,
    Untangle or its distributors will:

    a. provide to Licensee technical support by telephone or
       electronic mail during Untangle normal business hours
       concerning the use of the Hardware and the Installed Code as
       set forth in the Documentation;

    b. exercise commercially reasonable efforts to correct any
       programming defect in any Installed Code designed by Untangle;
       and

    c. deliver automatically to Licensee's Hardware unit maintenance
       releases, updates, enhancements, and/or modifications to the
       Installed Code.

    Licensee shall do nothing to prevent Untangle from automatically
    delivering and installing on the Hardware additional software
    ordered by Licensee, or delivering and installing maintenance
    releases, updates, enhancements, additional software and/or
    modifications to the Installed Code. Such maintenance releases,
    updates, enhancements, additional software, and/or modifications
    to the Installed Code shall constitute Installed Code for purposes
    of this License and shall be subject to all terms and conditions
    of this License.

3.  Untangle Right to Disable. IF LICENSEE FAILS TO PAY ANY FEE FOR
    THE SUBSCRIPTION SERVICE WHEN DUE, UNTANGLE SHALL HAVE THE RIGHT,
    WITHOUT PRIOR NOTICE TO LICENSEE, TO DISABLE ANY SOFTWARE
    INSTALLED ON LICENSEE'S HARDWARE UNIT INCLUDING, WITHOUT
    LIMITATION, THE INSTALLED SOFTWARE. UNTANGLE SHALL NOT BE LIABLE
    FOR ANY COSTS OR DAMAGES INCURRED BY LICENSEE OR ANY THIRD PARTY
    AS A RESULT OF ANY SOFTWARE BEING DISABLED BY UNTANGLE.

4.  Title. Title to the Installed Code shall remain with Untangle or
    its suppliers at all times. The rights granted under this License
    are personal to Licensee, and do not extend to any subsidiary,
    parent, or affiliate of Licensee. Title to the Hardware remains
    with Licensee.

    third parties under various licenses including, without
    limitation, the General Public License, the Lesser General Public

    the Installed Code except in connection with an assignment or
    other transfer of the Hardware containing the Installed Code, and
    then only upon the agreement by the assignee or transferee to the
    terms of this License.

7.  SPECIFIC DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTY AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.
    Licensee understands that Untangle provides no assurance that
    Licensee's network will operate with the Hardware. In addition,
    any change in the operating system or other software or
    configuration of Licensee's network may affect the performance and
    operation of the Hardware. ACCORDINGLY, UNTANGLE SHALL HAVE NO
    LIABILITY TO LICENSEE FOR ANY IMPAIRMENT OR NONPERFORMANCE OF ANY
    COMPUTER NETWORK OR ANY PORTION THEREOF.

    UNTANGLE DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE INSTALLED CODE IS ERROR-FREE OR
    THAT IT WILL OPERATE WITH LICENSEE'S COMPUTER NETWORK WITHOUT ANY
    IMPAIRMENT OF THE INSTALLED CODE OR LICENSEE'S COMPUTER
    NETWORK. THE HARDWARE AND THE INSTALLED CODE IS PROVIDED "AS IS"
    WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, WITH
    THE EXCEPTION OF A THREE YEAR PARTS AND LABOR WARRANTY ON THE
    HARDWARE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
    MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND
    NONINFRINGEMENT. UNTANGLE ALSO DISCLAIMS ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED
    WARRANTY CONCERNING ANY MAINTENANCE OR SUPPORT SERVICES PROVIDED
    TO LICENSEE INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE SUBSCRIPTION
    SERVICE. NEITHER UNTANGLE NOR ANY CONTRIBUTOR OF OPEN SOURCE SHALL
    BE LIABLE TO LICENSEE OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY DEFECTS IN THE
    INSTALLED CODE. UNTANGLE WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO LICENSEE FOR ANY
    LOST PROFITS, LOST SAVINGS, LOSS OF USE, OR OTHER SPECIAL,
    INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING IN TORT, CONTRACT, OR
    OTHERWISE, OR FOR ANY CLAIM BY ANY OTHER PARTY, ARISING OUT OF THE
    USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE INSTALLED CODE OR THE HARDWARE EVEN
    IF UNTANGLE HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
    DAMAGES. UNTANGLE'S LIABILTY TO LICENSEE IN ANY EVENT SHALL NOT
    EXCEED THE AMOUNT OF FEES PAID BY LICENSEE TO UNTANGLE. THIS
    DISCLAIMER CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS AGREEMENT, AND NO
    USE OF THE HARDWARE, INSTALLED CODE, OR SUBSCRIPTION SERVICE IS
    AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

8.  High Risk Activities. None of the Hardware, Installed Code, or
    Subscription Service is fault-tolerant and is not licensed for use
    in hazardous environments requiring fail-safe performance, such as
    in the operation of nuclear facilities, aircraft navigation or
    communication systems, air traffic control, direct life support
    machines, or weapons systems, in which the failure of the Hardware
    or Installed Code could lead directly to death, personal injury,
    or severe physical or environmental damage ("High Risk
    Activities"). ACCORDINGLY, LICENSOR AND ITS SUPPLIERS SPECIFICALLY
    DISCLAIM ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTY OF FITNESS FOR HIGH RISK
    ACTIVITIES. LICENSEE AGREES THAT UNTANGLE AND ITS SUPPLIERS WILL
    NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIMS OR DAMAGES ARISING FROM THE USE OF
    THE HARDWARE OR INSTALLED CODE IN SUCH APPLICATIONS.

9.  Termination: This License automatically terminates upon any breach
    by Licensee of any of its terms or conditions.

10. Governing Law: This License shall be governed by the laws of the
    State of California, U.S.A, without regard to its conflicts of

    rights arising out of or relating to this License, the prevailing
    party shall be entitled to recover reasonable attorney's fees. The

    federal courts located in San Mateo County, California, USA.

11. Entire Agreement. This License constitutes the entire agreement
    between the parties concerning Licensee's use of the Installed
    Code. This License supersedes any prior verbal understanding
    between the parties and any Licensee purchase order or other
    ordering document, regardless of whether such document is received
    by Untangle before or after Licensee agrees to this License. This
    License may be amended only in a writing signed by an authorized
    officer of Untangle specifically evidencing an intent to amend
    this License. Untangle may use Licensee's name in any customer
    reference list or in any press release issued by Untangle
