  <title>Sample Chapter With Sections</title>

  <para>
    This chapter covers a few more things, but is also interesting because it makes
    use of &lt;sect1>, &lt;sect2>, and &lt;sect3> elements.  These are natural ways
    to divide-up a chapter.  When outputting the chunked HTML, they also become their
    own files.

      <para>
      Most of you are used to bold and italic.  The DocBook equivilants are a
      bit more complex, in that they are more in context.  Here is a table of ones
      we may want to use.

                A way to bound quotes.  It likely renders with quotes "", but may also
                be italic and have slanted quotes.  Here is <quote>an example</quote>.

                This is the name of an application.  For a large UI, I believe it can also
                be used to refer to large sections of the UI such as the <application>Policy Manager</application>

      <title>Tables</title>
      <para>There are a few ways to do tables, but the intesection of table tweaks that
      look good in HTML and those that look good in PDF seems (based on my findings)
      to be 1.  So, here is how to make the one and only one table type.  If this pattern

      <para>
        Here we show how to create true hyperlinks to resources on the
        web, such as <ulink  url="http://www.google.com">Google</ulink>
        or a plain URL without alternative text <ulink url="http://www.metavize.com"/>

      <para>Now, we will reference a figure from the previous chapter,<xref linkend="chap1_fig_1"/>.
      Note that when doing such a reference, it is best to target
      something which had a "title" element, as that will become the display
      text for your link.  Note also it is good writing practice to never use
      positional text (i.e. "the figure below" or "the figure on the next page") as
      you do not know where the images will ultimatly be placed relative to the
      text.</para>

      <para>Here is a cross link to something which lacked a &lt;title> element, but substituted a &lt;xreflabel> element instead.  The link is to <xref linkend="chap1_random_paragraph"/></para>
