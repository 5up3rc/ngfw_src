      <title>Inline Markup</title>

      <para>
      Most of you are used to bold and italic.  The DocBook equivilants are a
      bit more complex, in that they are more in context.  DocBook does support
      the basic <emphasis>emphasis</emphasis> which can be thought of as bold.  It
      also supports <firstterm>firstterm</firstterm> to say "this is the first time
      this term has been used".  This is normally italic.
