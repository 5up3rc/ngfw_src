    The Packet Attack Shield Appliance protects your network in two ways.  First, it sanitizes all <glossterm linkend="gloss_packet">packets</glossterm> which traverse the &eg;.  As this is a built-in function, it has no administrative settings.
  </para>
  <para>
    Where the packet sanatizing feature protects against lower-level networking attacks, the Packet Attack Shield also protects against <glossterm linkend="gloss_dos">Denial of Service (DOS)</glossterm> attacks.  This feature is explained in more detail in <xref linkend="airgap_tran_shield_explained"/>.

    <para>
      The Packet Attack Shield Appliance keeps track of traffic from all hosts (IP addresses).  The quantity of connections and the volume of data are monitored.  Should a given host be significantly more active than others, it's <quote>reputation</quote> increases.  Reputation is expressed as a number on a relative scale.  Higher reputation numbers intidate a given host is consuming greater resources (more connections, more bytes transferred).
    </para>
    <para>
      As the load on a given &eg; increases, the system does not have enough resources to service all requests.  Rather than <quote>slow everyone down</quote>, Packet Attack Shield Appliance begins to take action against those hosts with the greatest reputation.  In this way, hosts that are <quote>hogging all the bandwidth</quote> are forced to make due with less while <quote>normal</quote> clients see no change in service levels.  There are actualy three actions that the Packet Attack Shield Appliance can take against hosts with high reputations, enumerated in <xref linkend="airgap_tran_shield_actions"/>.

      This feature of limiting resources based on reputation is used to prevent Denial Of Service attacks and other forms of malicious code.  Consider the host attempting to flood a given network protected by an &eg;.  The attacking host's reputation would increase, such that their communications would move quickly from being limited to rejected.

    <title>Administrative Interface</title>
    <para>
      The Administrative Interface to the Packet Attack Shield Appliance is minimal, as most of the behavior is automatic.  The only real setting is to instruct the system that a given host should be permitted to consume extra resources when its <link linkend="airgap_tran_shield_explained">reputation</link> is computed.  This administrative setting is explained in <xref linkend="airgap_tran_exceptionlist"/>.  The Event Log tab, explained in <xref linkend="airgap_tran_eventlog"/>, allows administrators to view events (see <xref linkend="introduction_ui_appliance_event_log"/> for general information about &eg; Event Logs).
