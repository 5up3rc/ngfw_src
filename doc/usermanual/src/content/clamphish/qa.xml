          <para>Why is blocking (or quarantining) of emails when phishing emails detected not always an option?</para>
        </question>
        <answer>
          <para>
            Only the SMTP protocol allows the &eg; to block mails.  The details of the POP and IMAP protocols prevent them from being blocked or quarantined.

        <question>
          <para>When configuring my &eg; to <guilabel>mark</guilabel> phishing emails received over IMAP, the subject of the mails changes to <quote><userinput>[PHISH]...</userinput></quote> only after I click on the message.  Why?</para>
        </question>
        <answer>
          <para>
            Most IMAP clients first fetch summary information about emails (subject, sender) so the end user can see a preview list of messages.  Only when the user selects (clicks on) the message is the actual content of the message retrieved from the server.  It is then that the &eg; is able to scan the message.  Unfortunately, some email clients do not detect the change in subject and update their preview list.

        <question>
          <para>Why does the <link linkend="clamphish_tran_adminui_events">Event Log</link> report the sender as my bank, yet is was fraudulent?  Why does it not report the <quote>real</quote> sender?</para>
        </question>
        <answer>
          <para>
            One of the characteristics of phishing emails is that they use deception to change the apparent sender of an email.  Although &eg; can detect the email as a phishing attempt, there is no way to determine the true sender.
