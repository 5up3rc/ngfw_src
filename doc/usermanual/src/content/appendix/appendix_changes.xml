  These are completely free for 30 days.  After 30 days the appliance will
  automatically turn off. 
        </para>
      <para>
  While the trial is going on, the appliance may be purchased
  from the store at any time, including after expiration.  Once purchased, the
  running appliance will automatically convert into the full version, preserving
  any configuration and event information.

      <title>Setup Wizard</title>
      <listitem>
        <para>
  The setup wizard has been streamlined in this release.  In particular
  it now recommends the correct setting for the formerly difficult router/bridge
  step.  The wizard should now correctly establish DHCP connectivity in all situations.
  Also the Router appliance no longer appears in the Toolbox if it is not used.

      <title>Router</title>
      <listitem>
        <para>
The Redirect panel inside of the Router Application has been streamlined for
ease of use. There are now two types of redirects, "Port Forwards" and
Redirects. "Port Forwards" are simplified redirects that are designed to make a
server on the internal network available to the outside
world.  Redirects implement the full power of traffic redirection that was
available in previous releases.

      <title>New Appliance: 24-hour Replacement Service</title>
      <listitem>
        <para>
  This is a new software appliance that automatically backs up your EdgeGuard's
  configuration to Metavize's data center every day.  If your box
  fails, just contact Metavize support and we'll ship you a replacement within
  24 hours.  The replacement will be pre-configured to your exact
  configuration as of the previous day.  Just plug it in and you're good to go.

      <title>Network Sharing advances to a Router</title>
      <listitem>
        <para>
  The 'Router' Appliance, previously known as 'Network Sharing', now has an advanced
  mode which provides more fine tuned configuration of your network.  The standard
  mode is unchanged, with the exception of an "Advanced" tab that lets you switch to
  and from advanced mode.  This is presently a one way operation, all settings are
  reset when switching from advanced to basic mode. 
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
 In advanced mode, each physical interface is mapped to one "Network Space".  A
  Network Space defines the network of hosts connected to each interface.  The
  external interface is always assigned to the "Public Space" which is configured
  using the 'Networking' panel in the Config tab.  In Advanced Mode it is possible
  to configure more elaborate configurations such as sharing independent public IP
  address for the the Internal and DMZ interface, bridging the Internal and DMZ
  interface, and modifying the Maximum Transmission Unit(MTU) for each Network Space.
  Advanced mode also incorporates a panel for configuring static routing for the network.

        <para>
          <emphasis>Digest Emails</emphasis>
        </para>
        <para>
  Quarantined emails may now be redirected to another email address.  This allows, for
  example, users to redirect Spam sent to a distribution list to
  the owner of that list.  This way the distribution list will not receive
  the quarantine digest, but rather the owner will receive them as a part of their
  existing digest.
        </para>
        <para>
  When viewing your inbox you can now sort the view by subject, sender, or score, in
  addition to the default sort of newest first.  You may also control how many messages
  are shows in each page of the inbox.
        </para>
        <para>
  The message digest now indicates for each message if there is an attachment.
        </para>
        <para>
  Message digest emails are now viewable when outside the EdgeGuard, and the links work
  from outside as well.
        </para>
        <para>
  The message digest is no longer sent each day if no new emails were quarantined since the
  previous day.

      <title>UI - General</title>
      <listitem>
        <para>
  A visual hint is added when a new appliance is installed lets the user know that it

  turned on, the hint is no longer displayed.
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
  A visual hint is added for saving settings. Once any setting is changed, a hint is

  effect. The hint is removed once settings are saved or if they are restored to
  their previous values with the 'reload settings' button.

      <listitem>
        <para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <title>Email Sending</title>
      <listitem>
        <para>
  The EdgeGuard now runs a local outgoing-only mail server.  This is used to send out
  Quarantine, Report, Notification, and OpenVPN emails.  This makes the use of an external SMTP
  server optional.  When an external SMTP server is used, the local mail server 
  allows emails to be received even if the external server is temporarily unavailable.
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
  There is now a connectivity test available for email.  This allows sending a test email
  to verify that outgoing emails are working.

      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
  There is now a global setting for the 'From' address for all outgoing emails (Quarantine,

    <itemizedlist>
      <title>Networking Environment</title>
      <listitem>
        <para>
  The EdgeGuard now has a settable hostname.  This may be set in the wizard
  or later via the Config/Networking/Hostname panel.  This hostname is served
  up by the Router's DNS server if it is enabled.
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
  Network interfaces may now have their port speed configured manually. (eg:
  hardwired at 100Mb) This is useful in environments where auto negotiation
  leads to problems with buggy third-party networking equipment.
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
  Dynamic DNS is now supported.  This allows those without a permanent IP address, or
  without a public DNS server, to automatically update their hostname to one of
  three Dynamic DNS services: dyndns.org, easydns.com, and zoneedit.com.

    </itemizedlist>

    <itemizedlist>
      <title>HTTPS Access</title>
      <listitem>
        <para>
  Since EdgeGuard now has a hostname, it generates HTTPS self-signed certificates using
  that hostname.  It is also able to generate a Certificate Signature Request, which may
  then be used to purchase a public Certificate from Verisign, Thawte, etc.  This allows
  users to connect to EdgeGuard without getting a browser warning about the certificate.
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
  Emails sent out with a link back to EdgeGuard in them (Quarantine, OpenVPN) now use
  EdgeGuard's hostname in the link if the hostname is publicly resolvable.  A checkbox
  in the Config/Networking panel allows to user to specify whether the hostname is
  publicly resolvable.

        <para>
  Read-only administration accounts may now be created.  This allows administrators to
