          <para>For Email, why is blocking (or quarantining) of emails when a virus is detected not always an option?</para>
        </question>
        <answer>
          <para>
            Only the SMTP protocol allows the &eg; to block email messages.  The details of the POP and IMAP protocols do not allow the &eg; to block or quarantine email messages.

        <question>
          <para>When configuring my &eg; to <guilabel>mark</guilabel> virus emails received over IMAP, the subject of the mails changes to <quote><userinput>[VIRUS]...</userinput></quote> only after I click on the message.  Why?</para>
        </question>
        <answer>
          <para>
            Most IMAP clients first fetch summary information about emails (subject, sender) so the end user can see a preview list of messages.  Only when the user selects (clicks on) the message is the actual content of the message retrieved from the server and the &eg; is able to scan the message.  Unfortunately, some email clients do not detect the change in subject and update their preview list when the &eg; marks the message.
