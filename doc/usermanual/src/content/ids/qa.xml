          <para>
            In the Event Logs for the Intrusion Prevention Appliance, I see references to an attack on  <constant>XYZ</constant> mail server, yet we do not run <constant>XYZ</constant> server.  Why is this?</para>
        </question>
        <answer>
          <para>
            Attackers often try to exploit known security holes for a server whether or not such a server is present or running.  They try everything in the hopes of finding an unprotected system.

          <para>
            How is the Intrusion Prevention Appliance different from <link linkend="protofilter_tran">Rogue Protocol Control</link>?</para>
        </question>
        <answer>
          <para>
            Although both are signature based, the Rogue Protocol Control appliance blocks software applications which, although potentially time wasting or unwanted, do not attempt to harm your protected network.
