        <question>
          <para>If I have a single <quote>big</quote> machine (database, file server, print server, etc) and another smaller server.  Will my <quote>big</quote> machine develop a bad reputation?</para>
        </question>
        <answer>
          <para>
            The reputation for the <quote>big</quote> machine will be larger than the small machine.  In a normal deployment this should not be a concern, as the &eg; should not be limited in its overall resources.  If slowdown under heavy load is a concern, the <quote>big</quote> machine can have its reputation calculated differently as discussed in <xref linkend="airgap_tran_exceptionlist"/>.
