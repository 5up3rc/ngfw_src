  <para>
    The Attack Shield Appliance protects your network in two ways.  It sanitizes all <glossterm linkend="gloss_packet">packets</glossterm> the &eg; receives.  This packet-cleaning is a built-in function and has no administrative settings.
  </para>
  <para>
    In addition to protecting against lower-level networking attacks, the Attack Shield also protects against <glossterm linkend="gloss_dos">Denial of Service (DOS)</glossterm> attacks.  This feature is explained in more detail in <xref linkend="airgap_tran_shield_explained"/>.

    <para>
      The Attack Shield Appliance keeps tracks traffic from all hosts (IP addresses).  The number of connections and the volume of data are monitored.  If a given host is significantly more active than others, its <quote>reputation</quote> increases.  Reputation is expressed as a number on a relative scale.  Large reputation numbers indicate that a given host is consuming more resources (more connections, more bytes transferred) than its peers.
    </para>
    <para>
      As the load on an &eg; increases, it will not have enough resources to service all requests.  Rather than <quote>slow everyone down</quote>, the Attack Shield Appliance takes action against those hosts with the largest reputation numbers.  In this way, hosts that <quote>hog all the bandwidth</quote> are allocated fewer resources while <quote>normal</quote> clients see no change in service and performance levels.  There are three actions that the Attack Shield Appliance can take against hosts with large reputation numbers, enumerated in <xref linkend="airgap_tran_shield_actions"/>.

    <para>
      By using reputation numbers to allocate resources, the Attack Shield Appliance protects a network from Denial of Service attacks.  When a host attempts to flood a network protected by the &eg;, the attacking host's reputation number quickly increases so that the host moves from experiencing a limited slowdown to being denied access to protected resources.

    <title>Administrative Interface</title>
    <para>
      The Attack Shield Appliance does not have any settings for sanitizing packets, but does have a setting to specify a host that is treated differently than its peers in terms of reputation calculation.  This administrative setting is explained in <xref linkend="airgap_tran_exceptionlist"/>.  The Event Log tab, explained in <xref linkend="airgap_tran_eventlog"/>, allows administrators to view events (see <xref linkend="using_adminui_appliances_eventlog"/> for general information about &eg; Event Logs).

      <para>
        The Exception List is used to identify a virtual host (<glossterm linkend="gloss_ip_addr">IP Address</glossterm>) that represents more than one physical machine.  As discussed in <xref linkend="airgap_tran_shield_explained"/> the Attack Shield Appliance tracks the relative activity of hosts on its network.  If a given address represents more than one physical machine (for example, with <glossterm linkend="gloss_nat">NAT</glossterm>), then the Attack Shield Appliance must know this or it will consider the NATed network to be an unusually active single host.

This value is usually between 0 and 100, with larger numbers indicating greater resource consumption.
