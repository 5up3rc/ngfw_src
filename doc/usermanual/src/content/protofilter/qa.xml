          <para>I've already installed the Firewall Appliance.  Isn't The Rogue Protocol Control Appliance redundant?</para>
        </question>
        <answer>
          <para>
            The Firewall application works to block traffic for <glossterm linkend="gloss_ip_addr">IP addresses</glossterm> and/or <glossterm linkend="gloss_port">ports</glossterm>.  For well behaved applications (such as legitimate web and email servers) the port can be used to identify the protocol.  However, less legitimate applications may use different ports, or malicious users may deliberately use unwanted services on obscure ports.  
          </para>
          <para>
            The Rogue Protocol Control Appliance scans <emphasis>all</emphasis> traffic, looking for a <quote>match</quote> even if the traffic was not transported across the expected port for that protocol.

        <question>
          <para>I want to block <constant>[some file sharing protocol]</constant> for some of my users but not all.  How can I do this with Rogue Protocol Control?</para>
        </question>
        <answer>
          <para>
            The Rogue Protocol Appliance cannot by itself filter just for <quote>some</quote> machines, and not others.  However, you can create new Policies and Virtual Racks (see <xref linkend="policy_manager"/>) to partition some of your users through a Rogue Protocol Appliance with <constant>[some file sharing protocol]</constant> blocked and not others.
