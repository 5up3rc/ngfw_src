The docs changed between 3.1 and 3.2.  For maintainability, content has been broken into many more files.  Unfortunatly (due to XML limitations) these separate files must be declared in the top-level XML file.  Also, not that although content is in subdirectories *all paths are relative to the root*.  This is because we use entity inclusion, which can be though of like textual inclusion.
