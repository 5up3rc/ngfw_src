  <title id="simple_sample_chap">Simple Sample Chapter</title>

  <!--
    If the chapter is small or otherwise flat, you can just insert
    text directly, starting with a "para" tag.  If the chapter is
    long or complex (nested), you should consider "sect1", "sect2"
    tags.  This creates "sections", which show-up in an index as
    well as becoming their own HTML pages (when DocBook is converted
    to chunked HTML).

    If your chapter is *really* long or is likely to be authored
    by several people, consider splitting into separate files (see
    "eg250.xml" for more details).

    This chapter is simple, and "chap2" is more complex.


    On Links:
    =========
    In the text below are examples creating targets and links.  The mechanics
    will not be explained here.  However, the naming convention is important.
    All "files" for the manual are merged into a single XML document at
    generation time.  This is done by the XML parser.  Therefore, any targets
    (things linked-to) are in the *same* namespace although they do not seem
    as such while you are working in your own file.

    To avoid conflicts, please use the following convention for naming
    targets (IDs):

    filename_logicalTarget.

    For example, accessing the first section of "chap1.xml" may take on
    the target "chapt_sect1".

    There is some goofy-ass bug where things get mangled if you put the
    ID on the "title" instead of the outer-most element.  I saw some DocBook
    examples on the web where they put it on the title (naugty, naughty, naughty).

  <para>This chapter is full of little examples of markup that we may want to
  use.  If you need more than the markup listed here, please ask me.  My intent
  was to <emphasis>spare</emphasis> you from from having to read-up on DocBook.</para>

  <para>Here is a link to <glossterm linkend="gloss_fruit">a glossary entry</glossterm> </para>

  <para>
    Here we show how to create true hyperlinks to resources on the
    web, such as <ulink  url="http://www.google.com">Google</ulink>
    or a plain URL without alternative text <ulink url="http://www.metavize.com"/>
  </para>

  <para>Now, we will forward-reference a figure which is later on (a forward
  reference) <xref linkend="chap1_fig_1"/>.  Note that when doing such a reference, it is best to target
  something which had a "title" element, as that will become the display
  text for your link.  Note also it is good writing practice to never use
  positional text (i.e. "the figure below" or "the figure on the next page") as
  you do not know where the images will ultimatly be placed relative to the
  text.</para>

  <para>Now, we'll go back and reference the image a few paragraphs back.  If

  <para>Now, here is an example of a numbered list.  This does not have a title,
  so you should not reference it (i.e. do not give it an "ID" attribute)</para>

  <para>Now, we will create an ordered list <emphasis>with</emphasis> a title and

  <para> For completeness, here are a few other sample list types</para>


  <itemizedlist>

    <title>Un-numbered list</title>

    <listitem>
      <para>And a third</para>
    </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>

  <para>Here is an odd type of list.  I guess it is good for introducing terms.  It
  seems on the border of making something its own "small" section vs. one of these lists.</para>

  <para>We will now explore the "correct" way to add little assides to your document.
  In books these are sometimes sidebars, and sometimes in-line with text.</para>
 
  <para>This has the five types of callouts.  For each, we show with and without a title
  (when title not provided, one is assumed by the processor)
