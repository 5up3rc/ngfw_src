  <title id="simple_sample_chap">Simple Sample Chapter</title>

  <para>
    This chapter and <xref linkend="sample_chap_with_sections"/> are two chapters created
    to demonstrate some basic markup in DocBook.  Note that both chapters demonstrate different
    things, as well as the fact that this chapter is flat, and the other chapter has nested
    sections.
  </para>

  <para>
    Most DocBook stuff should be fairly straightforward.  Its like HTML, with its own tag set.  The
    only slightly "tricky" piece is linking and file layout.  
  </para>
  <para>
    This document has been divided into many .xml files.  However, this is a "trick" from the
    XML parser.  The docbook processor does not know this isn't one file.  As such, anytime you name
    something keep in mind <emphasis>there is one namespace</emphasis>.  Creating an element
    and tagging it ...<varname>id="details"</varname> will likely conflict.  As such, the naming convention
    for <emphasis>everything</emphasis> is to prefix it with the file name.  If you have nested sections,
    those go in front of any name as well.  This also goes for any graphics images.  See me if you're confused by this.
  </para>

    <listitem>
      <para>Never refer to an image with directional nouns.  Do not write
      <quote>the image below</quote> as you do not know if the image
      will be below, or on the next page.
      </para> 
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para>If you think someone may want to refer to your section/chapter/table, then
      give it a title with the <varname>&lt;title></varname> tag.  Then, on the element
      itself, provide an ID attribute.  Note that when someone links (via &lt;xref>)
      to your content, their reference will cary the text of your title.</para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para>When using &lt;xref>, always let the linkend define the text.  </para>

      <para>Do not assume your text will be a section, chapter, etc forever.  It is best to avoid such
      positional language, as we may reorganize things</para>

  <para> For completeness, here are a few other sample list types</para>

  <para>Here is an odd type of list.  I guess it is good for introducing terms.  It
  seems on the border of making something its own "small" section vs. one of these lists.</para>

  <para>We will now explore the "correct" way to add little assides to your document.
  In books these are sometimes sidebars, and sometimes in-line with text.</para>
 
  <para>This has the five types of callouts.  For each, we show with and without a title
  (when title not provided, one is assumed by the processor)
