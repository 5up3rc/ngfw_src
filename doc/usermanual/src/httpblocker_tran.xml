    symbol.  If the Web Content Control Appliance is not installed, please refer to <xref linkend="using_adminui_appliances"/> for installation instructions.
  </para>
  <para>
    As its name implies, the Web Content Control Appliance is used to filter web traffic to your protected network for inappropriate content.  Unlike other software appliances, the the criteria used by the Web Content Control Appliance can be seen as subjective.  Inappropriate content may be executables to some, while to others it is web sites discussing Illegal Drugs.

    <title>Administrative Interface</title>

    <para>
      The interface for the Web Content Control is presented as three tabs.  The first two tabs, covered in sections <xref linkend="httpblocker_tran_block"/> and <xref linkend="httpblocker_tran_pass"/>, allow control over blocked and permitted content.   The last tab, discussed in <xref linkend="httpblocker_tran_eventlog"/>, allows administrators to view events.

        The Block List tab presents administrators the ability to modify the four major criteria of content filtering: by category, URL, MIME Type and File Extension.  Refer to the section for each sub-tab for more detail.

          Should a user within the protected network browse to a site which has been selected via the Category tab, they will be presented with an error page.  The page will inform the user that their request has been blocked by the Web Content Control Appliance.  They will also be told the category (<quote>Web Mail</quote>, <quote>Gambling</quote>, etc) of the site in question.

      <title>Pass Lists</title>
      <para>
        As discussed in <xref linkend="httpblocker_tran_block"/>, the Web Content Control Appliance offers several ways to block inappropriate or malicious traffic from entering your protected network.  However, there may be circumstances where you need to bypass these guards for an individual within your company, or a site outside your network.
      </para>
      <para>
        For this reason, the Pass Lists have been created.  When traffic is found to <quote>match</quote> an entry in one of the pass lists, it is <emphasis>not</emphasis> filtered.  Passes can be created for various sites, as discussed in <xref linkend="httpblocker_tran_pass_urls"/>, or for individual machines within the protected network as discussed in <xref linkend="httpblocker_tran_pass_clients"/>

    <title>Frequently Asked Questions</title>

        <question>
          <para>Why is there both blocking by MIME Type and File Extension?</para>
        </question>
        <answer>
          <para>
            In an ideal world, both pieces of information would always be present for every web request.  However, some sites use incorrect content types or extensions.  Also, the behavior of operating systems (Windows vs. Mac) is different when given only file extension or content type.  To be safe, both lists should be used.

        </question>
        <answer>
          <para>
            Set-up the policies as you would for employees.  Then, enter the addresses of alll public internet terminals into the Client Pass List as described in <xref linkend="httpblocker_tran_pass_clients"/>.
